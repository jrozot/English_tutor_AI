## ðŸŽ¯ Use Case

Originally designed with rural Colombian schools in mind, the system allows learners to submit English phrases and receive:

## ðŸ“‚ Training

The `training/` directory contains the structure for a simplified model training environment. While certain assets are simulated due to repository size limitations, you can explore real datasets suitable for grammar correction at:

- [Kaggle: English Grammar Errors Corpus](https://www.kaggle.com)
- [Cornell Movie Dialogues](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html)
- [OpenSubtitles](https://opus.nlpl.eu/OpenSubtitles.php)

These resources may help to explore future expansions or demonstrations of enhanced AI behavior.
